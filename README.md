# GroceryDigitalCoupon
Digital coupon clicker for Mariano's and Jewel - run in browser console

When run, this code automatically clicks as many coupons as allowable/visible on your screen. 

Instructions:
1) log into your grocery store account, go to the digital coupons page
2) I suggest sorting by expiration date or the categories you shop, because Mariano's allows a maximum of 150 coupons clicked
3) Open up javascript console for your browser (in chrome, view->developer->javascript console)
4) Paste in and run both sections of the code separately - the first imports jquery, the second clicks all the coupons on the page

Note: you might have to scroll down to reveal more coupons at bottom of page, or just run the code again to click more
